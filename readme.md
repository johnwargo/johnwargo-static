# John Wargo Static

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1624bc35-9dff-463f-99d4-d17430f02752/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/johnwargo-static/deploys)

Temporary static placeholder web site for [johnwargo.com](http://johnwargo.com). I created this HTML site because I was having trouble with my Joomla! site hosted on FatCow. There was an issue with Image Magick and I couldn't get around it so I started looking for an alternative approach for hosting my site. I wanted to switch to a static site generator like Jekyll or Eleventy, so I put this site up while I sorted that out.

In the mean time, I was able to get around the technical issue with my Joomla site, so it's back up and running. I no longer need this.
